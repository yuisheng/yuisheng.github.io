title: Zhen Zhen, A Researcher and Earther

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Zhen Zhang!</h1>
    <p> I'm at present a postdoctoral scientist at <a href="https://geog.umd.edu">University of Maryland College Park</a>. I'm also a guest scientist at <a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en.html">Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL</a>.</p>
    <p>My research interests lie in two areas. The first is understanding and quantifying the changes in emissions of greenhouse gases (with a focus on methane (CH4)) from terrestrial ecosystems at regional to global scale - scales directly relevant to informing climate and policy - primarily through the use of a suite of modelling tools including dynamic global vegetation models, earth system models, and atmospheric models. The second area is assessing the impacts of climate change on global wetlands via its influences on ecosystem services. Overall, my research aims to improve our understanding of the global vegetation-climate interaction in the Anthropocene.</p>

    <p>I like rock climbing, hiking, and any other outdoor activities. </p>
